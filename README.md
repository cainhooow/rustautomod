# Rust Automod

Rust Automod is a Visual Studio Code extension that automates the management of `mod.rs` files in Rust projects. It eliminates the repetitive task of manually creating and maintaining module declarations, keeping your Rust project structure clean and organized.

## üöÄ What It Solves

- In Rust, a folder without a `mod.rs` file is not automatically recognized as a module. This can lead to tedious manual work when creating new files or folders. Rust Automod automates this by:

- Automatically creating a `mod.rs` file when a new Rust file is added to a folder.

- Adding new module declarations (`mod` or `pub mod`) in the `mod.rs` file automatically.

- Creating `mod.rs` in nested folders and updating the parent module automatically.

- Removing module declarations when a Rust file is deleted.

- Ensuring modules are sorted alphabetically (optional) and avoiding duplicates.

- Supporting project-specific configuration through a `.rautomod` file.

- **NEW: Toggle mod.rs visibility** ‚Üí Hide or show all `mod.rs` files in the VSCode Explorer with a single command, keeping your workspace cleaner.

## üìÅ .rautomod Configuration

![automodconfig](assets/automodconftour.gif)

You can place a `.rautomod` file in the root of your Rust project (or any folder) to customize Automod behavior. The available configuration options are:

```.rautomod
# 'pub' for public modules (pub mod), 'private' for private modules (mod)
visibility=pub

# 'alpha' to sort module declarations alphabetically, 'none' to preserve insertion order
sort=alpha          

pattern=crate,private,another......
```

### Basic Usage

```.rautomod
visibility=pub
sort=alpha
```

- Creates all module declarations as `pub mod`.
- Sorts modules alphabetically in `mod.rs`.

## Advanced Usage with Patterns

```.rautomod
# Make utils and helpers private and unsorted
visibility=private
sort=none
pattern=utils,helpers

# Make all other modules public and sorted
visibility=pub
sort=alpha
```

- The first block applies only to files/folders named `utils` or `helpers`.
- The second block (without `pattern`) is a fallback rule for all other files.
- Patterns support **comma-separated** lists and can match file or folder names.

This configuration will create all module declarations as pub mod and sort them alphabetically in mod.rs files.

## ‚ö° Features

- Automatic `mod.rs` creation: No need to manually create `mod.rs` when adding a new Rust file.

- Automatic module registration: Updates parent `mod.rs` and child folders automatically.

- Deletion support: Removes module declarations when files are deleted.

- Project-specific configuration: `.rautomod` allows different settings per project.

- Optional sorting: Alphabetical ordering of module declarations.

- IntelliSense support: Autocomplete for `.rautomod` keys (`visibility`, `sort`, `pattern`) and values (`pub`, `private`, `alpha`, `none`).

- Linting: `.rautomod` is validated with inline errors in VSCode.

- Hide/Show mod.rs files: Quickly toggle the visibility of all `mod.rs` files via the Command Palette (`Hidden/Show Rust Modules Files`).

## üõ† Installation

1. Open VSCode and go to Extensions.

2. Search for Rust Automod.

3. Install and reload VSCode.

## üìå Usage

1. Create a Rust project or open an existing one in VSCode.

2. Optionally, add a `.rautomod` file at the root with your desired settings.

3. Create a new Rust file inside any folder:
   - Automod will create or update `mod.rs`.
   - The new module will be added automatically.

4. Delete a Rust file:
   - Automod will remove the module declaration from `mod.rs`.

5. Use autocomplete and linting when editing `.rautomod` to ensure correct configuration.

## üí° Notes

- If no `.rautomod` file is found, Automod will fallback to the global VSCode settings (`rustautomod.visibility` and `rustautomod.sort`), defaulting to pub and none.
- Nested folders are supported; Automod will create `mod.rs` files recursively as needed.
- `pattern` rules allow per-folder or per-file customization for visibility and sorting.
